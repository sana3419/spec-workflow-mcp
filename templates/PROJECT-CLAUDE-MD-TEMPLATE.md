# Project CLAUDE.md

## MCP Tools

### spec-workflow-mcp (Workflow Management)
- `spec-workflow-guide` — Load workflow guide (call first each session)
- `steering-guide` — Create project steering docs
- `spec-status` — Progress + next task engine suggestion
- `approvals` — Approval workflow (request/status/delete)
- `log-implementation` — Record implementation logs and artifacts
- `verify-task` — Traffic-light verification (green/red signal)

### ai-cli-mcp (Multi-Engine Dispatch)
- `ai_cli_run` — Launch engine (DeepSeek/Gemini/Codex) in background, returns PID
- `ai_cli_wait` — Wait for engine completion, return result
- `ai_cli_peek` — Check engine progress
- `ai_cli_get_result` — Get engine result
- `ai_cli_doctor` — Check engine CLI availability

## Multi-Engine Dispatch

### IMPORTANT: Must dispatch via MCP tools, never execute yourself

When a task has `_Engine:` field or user requests a specific engine, **you MUST use MCP tools** to dispatch. Never execute the task yourself. Never call CLI via Bash.

| Engine | Dispatch Method | Purpose |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| DeepSeek (default) | `ai_cli_run(model="oc-deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro")` | Coding, refactoring, bug fixes |
| Gemini | `ai_cli_run(model="gemini-2.5-pro")` | Large-scale code/doc reading, codebase research, file analysis (free tier, large context) |
| Codex | `ai_cli_run(model="gpt-5.4")` | Image generation, SVG to polished images |
| Claude | Execute directly (no dispatch needed) | Planning, task decomposition, verification |

### IMPORTANT: Use Gemini for large-scale reading

When you need to read large codebases, documentation, or many files for research, **dispatch to Gemini** instead of reading files yourself or using Agent subagents. Gemini has a large free context window — use it to save Claude tokens. Tell Gemini what to read and where to write its summary report.

### IMPORTANT: Never pre-read content before dispatching

Do NOT use Read tool, cat, grep, git diff, or any method to load file content into your context before passing to an engine. Instead, instruct the engine to read files itself and **write a structured report to a designated path**.

Dispatch pattern:
```
1. Tell the engine WHAT to do, WHICH files to read, and WHERE to write its report
2. Engine reads files, executes task, writes report to .spec-workflow/reports/<engine>-<task>-<timestamp>.md
3. You read the report file to get results
```

Example — dispatching Gemini for code review:
```
ai_cli_run(
  model="gemini-2.5-pro",
  prompt="Review all changed files in this project for security vulnerabilities, logic errors, and performance issues. Read the files yourself. Write your complete review report to .spec-workflow/reports/gemini-review-20260521.md with sections: ## BLOCK, ## WARN, ## NOTE. Project path: /path/to/project"
)
```

Example — dispatching DeepSeek for coding:
```
ai_cli_run(
  model="oc-deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro",
  prompt="Implement the user login endpoint with JWT authentication. Read src/auth/ for existing patterns. Write implementation and update tests. Project path: /path/to/project"
)
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning (Claude executes directly)
1. Call `spec-workflow-guide` to load workflow
2. Discuss requirements with user → write `requirements.md` → submit for approval
3. Write `design.md` → submit for approval
4. Write `tasks.md` (mark `_Engine:` per task) → submit for approval
5. User approves each phase on dashboard (can request changes)

### Phase 2: Implementation (task loop)
1. Call `spec-status` → get next pending task + engine suggestion
2. Edit `tasks.md`: `[ ]` → `[-]` to mark started
3. Dispatch to engine via MCP based on `_Engine` field
4. Read engine's report from `.spec-workflow/reports/` or get result via `ai_cli_wait`
5. Run tests to verify
6. Call `verify-task`:
   - `signal: "green"` → auto-marks `[x]`, then call `log-implementation`
   - `signal: "red"` → record failure, fix and retry (auto-blocked after maxFixAttempts)
7. Call `log-implementation` to record artifacts
8. Continue to next task

### Phase 3: Research Report (optional)
After all tasks complete:
1. Claude writes Markdown report (`docs/report/report.md`)
2. Claude generates SVG diagrams → `docs/report/svg/`
3. Dispatch Codex: `ai_cli_run(model="gpt-5.4", prompt="Convert SVG files in docs/report/svg/ to polished PNG images. Save to docs/report/images/. Use creative visual style.")`
4. Run `python3 <spec-workflow-mcp>/tools/gen-report.py docs/report/report.md -o docs/report/report.docx --images docs/report/images/`

Markdown report format:
```
# Title                         → Paper title (centered, bold)
Author: xxx  Advisor: xxx       → Author line
Abstract: xxx                   → Abstract
Keywords: xxx                   → Keywords
## 1. Introduction              → Level 1 heading
### 1.1 xxx                     → Level 2 heading
#### 1.1.1 xxx                  → Level 3 heading
Body text                       → Normal paragraph
![Caption](path)                → Image + caption
| Header | ...                  → Table
[1] Reference...                → Reference
```

## Skills (4, from GStack + Superpowers)

Built-in skills in `.claude/skills/`, dispatch to engines via MCP:

| Skill | Engine | Dispatch | Purpose |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| `/review` | Gemini | `ai_cli_run(model="gemini-2.5-pro")` | Code review: security, logic, performance |
| `/qa` | DeepSeek | `ai_cli_run(model="oc-deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro")` | Systematic QA testing + atomic fixes |
| `/design-review` | Claude | Execute directly | Visual/interaction audit (multimodal) |
| `/tdd` | DeepSeek | `ai_cli_run(model="oc-deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro")` | TDD red-green-refactor + worktree isolation |

## Review Subagents (4, parallel isolated context)

In `.claude/agents/`, run in isolated context:

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `security-reviewer` | Injection, auth flaws, hardcoded secrets, CVE |
| `logic-reviewer` | Edge cases, race conditions, resource leaks |
| `performance-reviewer` | N+1 queries, memory leaks, blocking ops |
| `api-reviewer` | Naming, HTTP semantics, versioning, validation |

Usage: "Run security review with subagent" or "Full review" (launches all 4 in parallel).

### Fault Handling
- Blocked tasks: drag back to pending on dashboard to retry
- Task auto-blocked after `maxFixAttempts` failures

## Rules

1. **IMPORTANT: Dispatch coding tasks via MCP** — All coding/implementation tasks MUST be dispatched via `ai_cli_run(model="oc-deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro")` by default. Never write implementation code yourself. Exception: `_Engine: claude` explicitly set, OR the task is planning/verification/documentation (non-coding) → execute directly.
2. **IMPORTANT: Never pre-read content** — Do not load file content into your context before dispatching. Tell the engine to read files and write a report to `.spec-workflow/reports/<engine>-<task>-<timestamp>.md`. Read the report afterward.
3. **IMPORTANT: All prompts to external engines MUST be in English** — When dispatching tasks via `ai_cli_run`, the prompt parameter MUST be written in English, even if the user speaks Chinese. External engines perform better with English prompts. User-facing output can remain in the user's language.
4. **Call `spec-workflow-guide` first** each new session
5. **Read before write** — understand existing code before modifying
6. **verify-task is mandatory** — every task must pass verification
7. **log-implementation is mandatory** — record after verify-task green
8. **No scope creep** — only implement what the task describes
9. **Approval required** — each phase document must be approved before proceeding. NEVER delete or cancel an approval request yourself. NEVER skip approval by proceeding without it. Wait for the user to approve on dashboard.
10. **Poll after submitting approval** — After calling `approvals action:"request"`, immediately start polling `approvals action:"status"` every 30 seconds until status changes from `pending`. Do NOT wait for user to tell you. Continue to next phase once approved. If rejected or changes requested, revise and resubmit. If still pending after 10 minutes, ask the user — do NOT auto-cancel or skip.

## Engine Report Convention

All engine outputs should be written to `.spec-workflow/reports/` with naming:
```
.spec-workflow/reports/

├── deepseek-impl-task1-20260521-150000.md # DeepSeek implementation log
├── codex-images-20260521-160000.md        # Codex image generation log
└── ...
```

Format: `<engine>-<type>-<identifier>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md`
