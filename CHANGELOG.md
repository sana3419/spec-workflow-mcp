# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.7] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Blocked Task Status** (PR #198) - Added a fourth task status for marking tasks as blocked:
  - New `[~]` checkbox marker in `tasks.md` representing blocked tasks
  - Optional `_Blocked: reason_` metadata for documenting why a task is blocked
  - Blocked reason is automatically removed when task status changes
  - Blocked column in Kanban board with red/ban-icon styling and drag-and-drop support
  - Blocked filter pill in status filters and status dropdown
  - Full support across web dashboard, VS Code extension, and MCP guide
  - All 22 locale files updated (11 dashboard + 11 extension)

### Security
- **Fix Approval Category Path Traversal** (Issue #220) - Prevented writing approval files outside the `.spec-workflow/approvals` directory via crafted `categoryName` values:
  - Added defense-in-depth validation at both the MCP tool handler (`src/tools/approvals.ts`) and the storage layer (`src/dashboard/approval-storage.ts`)
  - Reject `categoryName` containing `..`, `/`, or `\` at the tool boundary with a clear security error
  - Replaced all raw `join(this.approvalsDir, categoryName)` calls with `PathUtils.safeJoin()` which enforces path containment within the approvals directory
  - Hardened `findApprovalPath()` and `getAllApprovals()` to skip directory entries that fail validation instead of crashing
- **Bump simple-git to 3.36.0** (CVE-2026-28292, CVSS 9.8) - Fixed critical RCE vulnerability via case-sensitivity bypass of protocol allowlist checks in `block-unsafe-operations-plugin.ts`. The `[a-z]` regex character class missed uppercase variants (e.g. `PROTOCOL.ALLOW=always`), allowing an attacker to bypass two prior CVE patches and execute arbitrary commands via git operations.
- **Bump fastify to 5.8.5** (CVE-2026-33806) - Fixed body schema validation bypass via leading space character in `Content-Type` header. A regression from CVE-2025-32442 fix that allowed `\x20application/json` to skip `schema.body.content` validation entirely.
- **Bump vite to 7.3.2** (CVE-2026-39365, CVE-2026-39363, CVE-2026-39364) - Fixed path traversal in `.map` file handling, arbitrary file read via WebSocket `fetchModule`, and `server.fs.deny` bypass via query parameters.

## [2.2.6] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Task Logging Workflow Guidance** (PR #200) - Strengthened implementation instructions so AI agents are explicitly directed to record implementation details before marking tasks complete:
  - Updated the `implement-task` prompt to make `log-implementation` a mandatory step before changing tasks from `[-]` to `[x]`
  - Updated the `spec-workflow-guide` implementation phase to reinforce the same ordering and emphasize implementation logs as required workflow context for future agents

## [2.2.5] - 2026-03-02

### Security
- **Upgrade Fastify and Plugins** - Resolved all remaining npm audit vulnerabilities by upgrading from Fastify v4 to v5:
  - `fastify` 4.29.1 -> 5.7.4 (fixes DoS via unbounded memory in sendWebStream, Content-Type header bypass)
  - `@fastify/cors` 9.0.1 -> 11.2.0
  - `@fastify/static` 7.0.4 -> 9.0.0
  - `@fastify/websocket` 8.3.1 -> 11.2.0
  - Updated WebSocket handler to use v11 API (socket-first signature instead of connection wrapper)
  - Also resolved: `@isaacs/brace-expansion`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `ajv`, `hono`, `markdown-it`, `minimatch`, `qs`, `rollup` vulnerabilities via `npm audit fix`

## [2.2.4] - 2026-03-02

### Security
- **Fix Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability** (Issue #201) - Prevented reading files outside the project directory via crafted `filePath` values in approval requests:
  - Reject absolute paths and path traversal (`..`) sequences at three defense layers: MCP tool input, approval creation, and file path resolution
  - Replace unsafe `join()` calls with `PathUtils.safeJoin()` which validates resolved paths stay within project bounds
  - Add `PathUtils.validatePathWithinBases()` for verifying resolved paths against allowed directories
  - Previously, an attacker with dashboard access could read arbitrary system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) by creating approval requests with absolute or traversal paths

### Fixed
- **Empty Test Suite on Linux** - Case-sensitivity tests in `path-utils.test.ts` used a conditional `if` block that produced an empty `describe` on Linux, causing vitest to error. Replaced with `it.skipIf()` for proper test skipping
- **Missing `@mdx-js/mdx` Dependency** - Restored missing package to fix 4 cascading test suite failures

## [2.2.3] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **MDX Pre-Render Validation for Approvals** (PR #197) - All markdown files are now validated for MDX compatibility before approval requests are accepted:
  - Approval requests for any `.md` file are blocked if MDX compilation fails, preventing dashboard rendering issues
  - Actionable error messages with line/column references and fix suggestions (e.g., escape `<` as `&lt;` or use inline code)
  - Existing `tasks.md` structural validation still runs after MDX validation
- **`validate:mdx` CLI Script** - New `npm run validate:mdx` command for batch-scanning markdown files:
  - Scans all `.md` files in `.spec-workflow/specs/` and `.spec-workflow/steering/` directories
  - Supports `--spec <name>` to validate a single spec, `--file <path>` for a single file
  - `--json` output mode for CI/automation integration
- **MDX Validator Module** - New `src/core/mdx-validator.ts` using `@mdx-js/mdx` compile for syntax validation with structured error reporting

### Dependencies
- Added `@mdx-js/mdx` (^3.1.1) for MDX compilation-based validation

## [2.2.2] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **NPX Entrypoint Execution** (PR #195) - Fixed CLI silently not executing when invoked via `npx`:
  - Resolved symlinked paths using `realpathSync()` for proper entrypoint detection
  - `process.argv[1]` returns symlink path while `import.meta.url` returns real path, causing comparison to fail
  - Removed `process.stdin.resume()` in dashboard mode which could suspend the process in some shells

### Added
- **Markdown Thematic Breaks** - Added support for horizontal rules (`---`) in the dashboard editor:
  - Enabled `thematicBreakPlugin` in MDX editor
  - Added toolbar button for inserting thematic breaks

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **NPX Installation Error** (Issue #196) - Fixed "Cannot find package 'ajv'" error when installing via `npx`:
  - Added `ajv`, `ajv-formats`, and `zod` as direct dependencies to ensure proper ESM module resolution
  - These packages are required by `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` but npm's dependency hoisting in npx environments could fail to resolve them correctly
  - The fix ensures the MCP SDK's validation modules can always find their dependencies regardless of installation method

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **Git Worktree Support** (PR #194) - Separate worktree identity from shared `.spec-workflow` root:
  - Each git worktree now registers as its own project identity in the dashboard
  - Project labels reflect worktree context with `repo · worktree` naming format
  - `.spec-workflow` remains shared by default across worktrees (existing behavior preserved)
  - Artifact/approval content resolution now prioritizes workspace/worktree paths with workflow root fallback
  - New `--no-shared-worktree-specs` CLI flag to opt-out of sharing and use workspace-local `.spec-workflow`
  - Added `resolveGitWorkspaceRoot()` helper using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
  - Backward compatible: legacy registry entries without `workflowRootPath` are normalized automatically

### Added (Testing)
- Comprehensive test coverage for worktree functionality:
  - Unit tests for CLI argument parsing, git-utils, project-registry, and approval-storage path resolution
  - Integration tests for multi-server approval content resolution
  - E2E Playwright tests for no-shared worktree dashboard flow
  - New `test:e2e:worktree` npm script with dedicated Playwright config

## [2.1.12] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Approval Deeplinks** (Issue #192) - Approval requests now return direct URLs to specific approvals:
  - Dashboard URL includes approval ID as query parameter: `/approvals?id={approvalId}`
  - Clicking a deeplink auto-scrolls to the specific approval and highlights it with an amber ring
  - Approval is automatically expanded when navigating via deeplink
  - Improves workflow when running multiple AI agents in parallel

## [2.1.11] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Subdirectory Path Resolution** (Issue #189) - Fixed "Path traversal detected" error when starting the MCP server from a subdirectory within a git repository:
  - `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` returns relative paths (e.g., `../../.git`) when run from subdirectories
  - Updated `resolveGitRoot()` to use `path.resolve()` for converting relative paths to absolute paths
  - Absolute paths (Unix and Windows) are returned unchanged to preserve existing worktree behavior
  - Added test coverage for relative path scenarios

- **Task Prompt Spec Mismatch** (Issue #191) - Fixed copied task prompts using wrong spec name when switching between specs:
  - When selecting a spec without tasks, stale tasks from the previous spec remained displayed
  - Copying the prompt would incorrectly use the new spec name with old task data
  - Now clears task data immediately when switching specs to prevent stale data display

## [2.1.10] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- **Bulk Approval Management** (PR #181) - New batch selection and action system for managing multiple approval requests:
  - **Selection Mode** - Toggle to enable multi-select with visual checkboxes on approval items
  - **Select All / Deselect All** - Quick controls to select or clear all visible approval items
  - **Batch Actions** - Approve All or Reject All selected items in a single operation
  - **Undo Operations** - 30-second undo window with visual progress bar countdown after batch actions
  - **Continue-on-Error** - Batch operations process all items and report individual failures without stopping
  - **Security Controls** - Batch size limit of 100 items, ID validation with alphanumeric regex pattern
  - **Full i18n Support** - Translations for all 11 supported locales

- **Custom Typography System** - Added locally-bundled fonts for improved readability and visual consistency:
  - **Inter** (400, 500, 600, 700 weights) - Modern sans-serif for UI text, designed for screens
  - **JetBrains Mono** (400, 500, 700 weights) - Developer-focused monospace for code and specs
  - Fonts are bundled locally in the build (no CDN dependency)
  - Added `font-display: swap` for optimal loading performance
  - Added `unicode-range` for efficient font subsetting
  - Updated `--font-sans` and `--font-mono` CSS variables with new fonts and fallback stack

### Changed
- **Utility Consolidation** - Eliminated duplicate utility functions across the codebase:
  - Created shared `dateUtils.ts` with `formatDate()` and `formatDistanceToNow()` functions
  - Consolidated 5 duplicate `formatDate` implementations from SpecsPage, TasksPage, LogsPage, ApprovalsPage, and SteeringPage
  - Created shared `colorUtils.ts` for VSCode webview with `isValidHex()` and `hexToRgba()` functions
  - Removed duplicate color validation logic from CommentModal component

- **Design Token Migration** - Replaced hardcoded Tailwind colors with CSS variable design tokens:
  - Updated DashboardStatistics to use `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--text-muted` tokens
  - Updated SideBySideView to use `--surface-inset`, `--surface-panel`, `--border-default` tokens
  - Updated ProjectDropdown to use design tokens for all gray color variants
  - Improved theming consistency between light and dark modes

- **ApprovalEditorService Refactor** - Extracted hardcoded decoration colors into constants:
  - Created `APPROVAL_STATUS_COLORS` constant for pending, approved, rejected, needs-revision, and commented states
  - Added `DECORATION_BORDER_RADIUS` constant for consistent styling

- **Build Script Improvement** - Updated `build:dashboard` script to automatically run `copy-static`:
  - Ensures dashboard builds are always copied to the correct serving location (`dist/dashboard/public/`)
  - Prevents issues where dashboard changes don't appear after rebuild

### Fixed
- **Changelog Modal Rendering** - Fixed the changelog modal displaying blank content when clicking the version badge:
  - Replaced complex MDXEditor component with lightweight custom markdown renderer
  - Added proper rendering for headers, bullet lists, nested lists, and bold text
  - Uses design token CSS variables for consistent theming in light/dark modes

## [2.1.9] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Git Worktree Support** (GitHub Issue #187) - Specs are now shared across git worktrees:
  - Auto-detects git worktrees and stores specs in the main repository's `.spec-workflow/` directory
  - All worktrees of the same repository share the same specs automatically
  - New `SPEC_WORKFLOW_SHARED_ROOT` environment variable to override automatic detection
  - Silent fallback for non-git directories or when git is unavailable
  - Logs "Git worktree detected. Using main repo: <path>" when worktree is detected

- **MCP Tool Annotations** (PR #176) - Added semantic metadata annotations to all 5 tools for improved LLM tool understanding:
  - `readOnlyHint: true` for read-only tools (`spec-workflow-guide`, `steering-guide`, `spec-status`)
  - `destructiveHint: true` for state-modifying tools (`approvals`, `log-implementation`)
  - `title` annotations for human-readable tool display names
  - Enables MCP clients like Claude Code to auto-approve read-only tools and prompt for confirmation on destructive operations

### Changed
- **Design Tokens Refactor** - Replaced hardcoded colors and styles with design tokens for improved consistency:
  - Updated components including App, ApprovalsAnnotator, KanbanBoard, and others
  - New CSS variables for background, text, and border colors
  - Enhanced visual elements such as buttons, modals, and status indicators

### Fixed
- **Comments Section Height** - Improved height and layout of the Comments & Feedback section:
  - Increased height from 50vh to 70vh for better visibility
  - Added minimum height constraints to prevent collapsing to content height
  - Comments section now properly stretches to match the annotations panel height

### Security
- **Dependency Updates** - Fixed 8 vulnerabilities (6 high, 1 moderate, 1 low) via `npm audit fix`:
  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - ReDoS vulnerability (GHSA-8r9q-7v3j-jr4g)
  - `@remix-run/router` / `react-router` / `react-router-dom` - XSS via Open Redirects (GHSA-2w69-qvjg-hvjx)
  - `diff` - DoS vulnerability in parsePatch/applyPatch (GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx)
  - `hono` - JWT algorithm confusion vulnerabilities (GHSA-3vhc-576x-3qv4, GHSA-f67f-6cw9-8mq4)
  - `lodash-es` - Prototype Pollution in unset/omit functions (GHSA-xxjr-mmjv-4gpg)
  - `qs` - DoS via memory exhaustion in arrayLimit (GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p)

## [2.1.8] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Side-by-Side Annotation View** (GitHub Issue #179) - New view mode in the Approvals tab that displays source markdown and rendered preview side-by-side:
  - Left panel shows source text with full annotation capability
  - Right panel shows live rendered markdown preview using MDXEditorWrapper
  - Bidirectional scroll synchronization between panels with toggle to enable/disable
  - Full-width layout with comments section stacked below (not sidebar)
  - Responsive design: panels stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on tablet+
  - New mode button in the Approvals tab mode switcher alongside Preview and Annotate

- **Edit Button on Comment Cards** - Added edit button (pencil icon) to comment cards in the Comments & Feedback section for quick access to edit annotations

### Changed
- **Text Annotation Library Integration** - Replaced manual highlight implementation with `react-text-annotate-blend` library:
  - More reliable text selection and offset calculation
  - Consistent highlighting between Annotate and Side-by-Side modes
  - Handles edge cases (line endings, special characters) automatically
  - Shows annotation tag/ID inline with highlighted text

- **Comment Card Redesign** - Improved comment card layout following design principles:
  - Clean card structure with header (type badge + actions) and body sections
  - Full comment ID displayed on separate line with monospace styling
  - Full highlighted text displayed without truncation (was limited to 80 chars)
  - Full comment text displayed without truncation
  - Better visual hierarchy with proper spacing and typography
  - White card background with subtle border for cleaner appearance

### Fixed
- **Highlight Click Handler** - Fixed clicking on highlights to open the edit modal:
  - Improved mark click detection using background color matching
  - Added fallback text-based matching for edge cases
  - Works reliably in both Annotate and Side-by-Side modes

### Dependencies
- Added `react-text-annotate-blend` (^1.2.0) - React 18 compatible text annotation library

## [2.1.7] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed
- **Missing ws Package Dependency** - Fixed `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error when running the package via npx:
  - Added `ws` package (^8.18.0) to dependencies (was missing, only @types/ws was in devDependencies)
  - The ws package is required at runtime by `dashboard/multi-server.ts` for WebSocket functionality
  - Users installing via `npx @pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp@latest` will now have all required dependencies

## [2.1.6] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed
- **Approvals Tool Path Translation Error** (PR #173) - Fixed error when `PathUtils.translatePath` is called with undefined or null values in the approvals tool:
  - Added defensive checks to `safeTranslatePath` helper function to guard against undefined/null input paths
  - Prevents runtime errors when path translation encounters missing or invalid path values
  - Improves stability of the approvals workflow on cross-platform environments

## [2.1.5] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **Codex CLI Transport Closed on Approvals** (PR #171) - Fixed intermittent "Transport closed" errors when using Codex CLI during approval workflows:
  - Changed `console.log` to `console.error` in approval snapshot creation to prevent stdout contamination
  - MCP protocol requires stdout to be reserved exclusively for JSON-RPC communication
  - Diagnostic messages now correctly use stderr, preventing JSON parsing errors in MCP clients

## [2.1.4] - 2025-12-14

### Fixed
- **Dashboard Annotation Word-Level Highlighting** (fixes #169) - Fixed issue where annotating text in the Dashboard Approvals tab would highlight all occurrences of the same text instead of just the specific selection:
  - Added `startOffset` and `endOffset` fields to capture exact character positions when selecting text for annotation
  - Rewrote `renderContentWithAnnotations()` to use position-based highlighting instead of global regex text-matching
  - Updated modal state and comment creation to preserve and pass position data
  - Existing annotations without position data fall back to highlighting the first occurrence only (backward compatible)

## [2.1.3] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed
- **Dashboard Startup Crash for Users with Older Data Files** (fixes #168) - Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')` error that prevented dashboard startup for users upgrading from older versions:
  - Added backward compatibility guard in `project-registry.ts` to ensure `instances` array exists on all registry entries
  - Added backward compatibility guard in `settings-manager.ts` to ensure `automationJobs` array exists in settings
  - Users with older `activeProjects.json` or `settings.json` files from previous versions can now start the dashboard without errors

## [2.1.2] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed
- **Dashboard JS/CSS Loading Fails with Custom Port** (fixes #167) - Fixed issue where the dashboard would fail to load JavaScript and CSS assets when using a custom port (e.g., `--port 5002`):
  - CORS `allowedOrigins` was hardcoded to port 5000, blocking requests from other ports
  - CSP `connect-src` directive was missing WebSocket origins for custom ports
  - Added `generateAllowedOrigins(port)` helper to dynamically generate allowed origins based on the actual port
  - Updated `getSecurityConfig()` to accept port parameter and generate port-aware CORS configuration
  - Updated `createSecurityHeadersMiddleware()` to include dynamic `connect-src` for WebSocket connections
  - Security configuration now correctly displays the actual allowed origins on startup

## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-09

### Added
- **Enterprise Security Features** (PR #165) - Comprehensive security controls for corporate environments:
  - **Localhost Binding** - Dashboard binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, preventing network exposure
  - **Rate Limiting** - 120 requests/minute per client with automatic cleanup to prevent abuse
  - **Audit Logging** - Structured JSON logs with timestamp, actor, action, and result for compliance
  - **Security Headers** - X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, Referrer-Policy
  - **CORS Protection** - Restricted to localhost origins by default
  - **Network Security Validation** - Explicit opt-in required for non-localhost binding (`SPEC_WORKFLOW_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_ACCESS=true`)

- **Docker Security Hardening** (PR #165) - Enhanced container security:
  - Non-root user execution (`node` user)
  - Read-only root filesystem
  - Dropped all Linux capabilities (`cap_drop: ALL`)
  - No privilege escalation (`no-new-privileges`)
  - Resource limits (CPU/memory) to prevent DoS
  - Proper signal handling with `dumb-init`
  - New `Dockerfile.prebuilt` for environments with limited Docker memory

- **New Configuration Options** - Environment variables for security control:
  - `SPEC_WORKFLOW_BIND_ADDRESS` - IP address to bind to (default: `127.0.0.1`)
  - `SPEC_WORKFLOW_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_ACCESS` - Explicit opt-in for network exposure
  - `SPEC_WORKFLOW_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` - Enable/disable rate limiting
  - `SPEC_WORKFLOW_CORS_ENABLED` - Enable/disable CORS protection

- **Health Check Endpoint** - New `/api/test` endpoint for monitoring dashboard availability

- **Docker Test Script** - Comprehensive `containers/test-docker.sh` script to validate security configurations

### Changed
- Docker Compose now defaults to localhost-only port binding (`127.0.0.1:5000:5000`)
- Dashboard displays security configuration status on startup
- Improved error messages for security configuration issues

### Fixed
- **Task Notification System Not Working** - Fixed task completion and in-progress notifications not appearing. The notification system now uses WebSocket event data directly instead of making separate API calls, eliminating race conditions and timing issues that prevented notifications from triggering.

- **Templates Shipped with CRLF Line Endings** (fixes #166) - Fixed issue where template files were shipped with Windows-style CRLF line endings, causing git to detect them as modified on Linux/WSL/macOS systems:
  - Updated `.gitattributes` to enforce LF line endings for markdown files (`*.md text eol=lf`)
  - Modified `scripts/copy-static.cjs` to normalize line endings to LF during the build process
  - Converted all template files in `src/markdown/templates/` from CRLF to LF
  - Templates are now cross-platform compatible and won't trigger spurious git changes

- **Self-Healing Project Registry** (fixes #164) - Fixed rapid project add/remove cycles when Claude Code recycles MCP processes:
  - **Multi-Instance Support** - Projects now track multiple MCP server instances (PIDs) simultaneously, allowing unlimited concurrent sessions per project
  - **Self-Healing Registration** - When an MCP server starts, it automatically cleans up dead PIDs from crashed sessions and reuses the project slot
  - **PID-Specific Cleanup** - MCP servers now only unregister their own instance on shutdown, leaving other active instances intact
  - **Removed Aggressive Cleanup** - Dashboard no longer runs periodic 30-second cleanup; MCP servers manage their own lifecycle
  - **PID Visibility** - Project dropdown now shows PID for single instances or instance count for multiple instances

- **Dashboard Disconnection During Approval Process** (fixes #162) - Fixed critical stability issue where dashboard WebSocket connections would disconnect when AI clients (e.g., Codex CLI) modified documents during the approval workflow:
  - **Approval Storage Debouncing** - Added 500ms debounce for approval file change events to prevent event flooding when approvals are rapidly created/modified
  - **Spec Broadcast Debouncing** - Added 300ms debounce for spec update broadcasts to coalesce rapid file changes into a single UI update
  - **WebSocket Heartbeat Monitoring** - Added ping/pong heartbeat mechanism to detect and clean up stale connections proactively
  - **File Watcher Debouncing** - Implemented 500ms debounce for spec file change events to prevent event flooding during rapid document modifications
  - **File Stability Detection** - Added file size stability checking before processing changes, preventing partial file reads during write operations
  - **Graceful Connection Cleanup** - Improved error handling in broadcast methods with scheduled cleanup to avoid modifying collections during iteration
  - **Exponential Backoff Reconnection** - Frontend WebSocket now uses exponential backoff (1s to 30s) for reconnection attempts instead of fixed 2s intervals
  - **Clean Disconnect Handling** - WebSocket client no longer attempts reconnection on clean close events (codes 1000, 1001)

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- **Unsaved Changes Modal Translations** - Added missing translations for the unsaved changes confirmation modal in Steering and Spec document editors across all 11 supported languages (Arabic, German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese)
- **Improved Diff Visibility in Changes Tab** (fixes #158) - Fixed issue where adding a single line would cause all subsequent text to appear as changed:
  - Replaced naive index-based line comparison with proper `diffLines` algorithm from the `diff` library
  - Now correctly identifies only the actual changed lines, not positional differences
  - Provides accurate visual diff representation matching user expectations

### Added
- **MDX Editor Integration** - Replaced basic markdown textareas with a full-featured rich text editor powered by MDXEditor:
  - **Rich Text Editing** - WYSIWYG editing experience with live preview for markdown content
  - **Toolbar Controls** - Full toolbar with formatting options (bold, italic, underline, headings, lists, links, tables, code blocks)
  - **Source Mode Toggle** - Switch between rich text and raw markdown source editing with a single click
  - **Code Block Support** - Syntax-highlighted code blocks with CodeMirror integration and language selector dropdown
  - **Mermaid Diagram Support** - Render Mermaid diagrams directly in the editor with live preview
  - **Dark Mode Support** - Complete dark theme styling for all editor components including:
    - Editor content area and toolbar
    - Source mode (CodeMirror) with proper syntax highlighting
    - Code blocks with themed gutters, line numbers, and selection
    - Dropdown menus and language selectors (scrollable with custom scrollbars)
    - Popups and dialogs
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Ctrl+S to save, standard text formatting shortcuts
  - **Auto-save Status** - Visual indicators for saving, saved, and unsaved changes states
  - **Character/Line Count** - Real-time statistics in the editor footer
  - Applied to both Steering Documents and Spec Documents editing modals

### Changed
- Steering document modals now show the editor even for empty/new documents, allowing users to create content directly

## [2.0.11] - 2025-11-28

### Changed
- **Flexible Approval Deletion** (PR #119) - Modified approval deletion logic to allow deleting approvals in any non-pending status:
  - Can now delete approvals with status: `approved`, `rejected`, or `needs-revision`
  - Only `pending` approvals are blocked from deletion (still awaiting review)
  - Improves flexibility for cleanup operations while preventing accidental deletion of approvals still awaiting review
  - Updated error messages and next steps guidance to clarify the new behavior
  - Updated documentation in TOOLS-REFERENCE.md and api-reference.md

## [2.0.10] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **Claude Code Plugin Support** (PR #121) - Added official Claude Code plugin configuration for easy installation from the Claude marketplace:
  - Two plugin variants available: `spec-workflow-mcp` (base) and `spec-workflow-mcp-with-dashboard` (auto-starts dashboard)
  - Plugins use `@latest` tag for automatic updates to newest releases
  - Added `npm run sync:plugin-version` script to keep plugin versions in sync with package.json
  - Added `npm run check:plugin-version` for CI validation of version consistency
- **`--no-open` Flag for Dashboard** (PR #147, fixes #145) - Added new command-line flag to prevent automatic browser opening when starting the dashboard:
  - Use `spec-workflow-mcp --dashboard --no-open` to start the dashboard without launching the browser
  - Useful in restricted Windows environments where firewall or antivirus software blocks browser launches from processes
  - Prevents "failed to start dashboard: spawn EPERM" errors for users without administrator privileges
  - Dashboard URL is still printed to console so users can manually navigate to it
- **Sandbox Environment Support** (fixes #144) - Added `SPEC_WORKFLOW_HOME` environment variable to support sandboxed MCP clients like Codex CLI:
  - Allows overriding the default global state directory (`~/.spec-workflow-mcp`) to a writable location
  - Essential for sandboxed environments where `$HOME` is read-only (e.g., Codex CLI with `sandbox_mode=workspace-write`)
  - Supports both absolute paths and relative paths (resolved against current working directory)
  - Added helpful error messages when permission errors occur, suggesting the `SPEC_WORKFLOW_HOME` workaround
  - Updated Docker configuration to use `SPEC_WORKFLOW_HOME` by default
  - Usage: `SPEC_WORKFLOW_HOME=/workspace/.spec-workflow-mcp npx spec-workflow-mcp /workspace`

### Fixed
- **Archived Specs Display Content Correctly** (PR #146) - Fixed critical bug where archived specs were not displaying content correctly in the dashboard:
  - Added new API endpoint `/api/projects/:projectId/specs/:name/all/archived` that reads documents from the archive path (`.spec-workflow/archive/specs/{name}/`) instead of the active specs path. This was missed during the multi-project dashboard implementation.
- **Tasks.md Format Validation** (fixes #151) - Added validation to ensure tasks.md follows the required format before approval:
  - New `task-validator.ts` module validates checkbox format (`- [ ]`), task IDs, and metadata delimiters
  - Validation runs automatically when requesting approval for tasks.md files
  - Blocks approval if format errors are found, with detailed error messages and fix suggestions

## [2.0.9] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **Republished Clean Package** - Version 2.0.8 accidentally included uncommitted frontend changes. This version contains only the committed code from PR #143.

## [2.0.8] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Dashboard "No Projects Available" Error After Spec Edits** (PR #143, fixes #142) - Fixed critical bug where editing spec documents caused the dashboard to show "No Projects Available" and the MCP client to report "Transport closed" errors:
  - Added error handling to async event handlers in `multi-server.ts` that were causing unhandled promise rejections
  - Added error handlers to all `chokidar` file watchers to prevent watcher crashes
  - Improved error logging with contextual messages for easier debugging
  - System now gracefully handles transient errors during file operations instead of crashing
  - WebSocket connections remain stable during spec document edits
  - No session reload required after editing spec documents
  - Added 7 comprehensive tests to verify watcher error handling and prevent regressions

## [2.0.7] - 2025-11-10

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Removed `get-implementation-logs` tool** - This tool is no longer available. AI agents should use native tools (grep/ripgrep) and Read to search implementation logs instead.

### Fixed
- **Volume Control Regression** (PR #141) - Fixed critical volume control regression from NotificationProvider context split through 6 progressive commits:
  1. Fixed volume icon always showing as muted by updating VolumeControl component to use both `useNotifications()` (actions) and `useNotificationState()` (state)
  2. Fixed stale closure bug where `handleTaskUpdate` callback had stale reference to `playNotificationSound`, and changed volume/sound settings storage from sessionStorage to localStorage for persistence
  3. Made audio fade-out proportional to volume level instead of fixed value
  4. Fixed Web Audio API gain timing issues with direct value assignment and linear ramping
  5. **Replaced Web Audio API with Howler.js** - After 4 failed attempts to fix volume control with raw Web Audio API, switched to industry-standard Howler.js library (546k weekly downloads, MDN-recommended) for reliable, simple audio playback with real MP3 files
  6. **Fixed sound not playing at all** - Integrated `playNotificationSound()` into `showNotification()` function so all notifications (task completion, status changes, approvals) automatically play sound at user-configured volume level
- **Dashboard Task Status Refresh** (PR #140) - Fixed critical "page reload" issue when updating task status:
  - Removed redundant `reloadAll()` call causing unnecessary full page refreshes
  - **Split ApiProvider context** into ApiDataContext (data) and ApiActionsContext (stable functions) to prevent unnecessary re-renders when data updates
  - Added deep equality checks in websocket handlers before updating state
  - Improved task list comparison from index-based to Map-based for robustness
  - Result: Task status updates are now smooth and instant without scroll position loss or page disruption
- **Docker Implementation** (PR #135) - Fixed Docker build failure and updated configuration:
  - Removed invalid `COPY --from=builder /app/src/locales` command (locales are bundled in dashboard build)
  - Updated Dockerfile to build from local source instead of git clone
  - Fixed docker-compose.yml build context and port mappings (3000 → 5000)
  - Added comprehensive documentation in `containers/README.md` and `containers/DOCKER_USAGE.md`
  - Added `.dockerignore`, `containers/.env.example`, and updated `containers/example.mcp.json`

### Changed
- **Implementation Logs Format Migration** (PRs #136, #137, #138) - Logs are now stored as individual markdown files instead of a single JSON file for improved scalability and direct agent accessibility.
  - Old format: `.spec-workflow/specs/{spec-name}/implementation-log.json`
  - New format: `.spec-workflow/specs/{spec-name}/Implementation Logs/*.md`
- Implementation logs are automatically migrated from JSON to markdown format on server startup.
- Updated all documentation and prompts to guide agents to use grep/ripgrep commands to search implementation logs.
- Updated VSCode extension file watcher to monitor markdown files in Implementation Logs directories.
- Updated dashboard and multi-server API endpoints to work with the new markdown format.
- Added validation for taskId and idValue in markdown log parser to match VSCode extension behavior.

### Added
- **Automatic Migration System** - New `ImplementationLogMigrator` utility class handles automatic conversion of existing JSON logs to markdown format.
- **Migration Logging** - Migration process is logged to `~/.spec-workflow-mcp/migration.log` for debugging and transparency.
- **Howler.js Audio Library** - Added howler@2.2.4 dependency for reliable, cross-browser notification sounds with proper volume control.

### Improved
- **Agent Discovery** - AI agents can now directly grep implementation logs without special tool calls, making discovery faster and more intuitive.
- **Log Readability** - Markdown format is more human-readable and can be directly edited if needed.
- **Scalability** - Individual markdown files prevent performance degradation when dealing with thousands of implementation logs.
- **Dashboard Performance** - Context splitting and deep equality checks prevent unnecessary re-renders, making the dashboard significantly more responsive.
- **Audio Quality** - Notification sounds now use real MP3 files (via Howler.js) instead of synthetic oscillator beeps for better user experience.

## [2.0.6] - 2025-11-08

### Changed
- Removed creation of `config.example.toml` file during workspace initialization as it is no longer needed or used.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed
- Fixed tools not respecting the project directory specified at server startup. Tools now use the server context's `projectPath` by default instead of requiring it as a mandatory argument.
- AI agents no longer need to pass `projectPath` to tools, preventing files from being created in the wrong directory (e.g., current working directory instead of the configured project directory).
- Updated `spec-status`, `get-implementation-logs`, `log-implementation`, and `approvals` tools to use context fallback pattern.
- Made `projectPath` optional in all tool input schemas while maintaining backward compatibility for explicit overrides.

## [2.0.4] - 2025-11-08

- Implementation Log functionality added to the dashboard for each spec, AI Agents will now log detailed information about the implementation of each task. This information is then used by future AI agents to discover existing code and avoid duplication / mistakes when implementing new tasks especially when each task is dependant on the previous task.

### Changed
- Re-designed the dashboard to be more user friendly and intuitive.
  - Added a new sidebar menu for the dashboard instead of header navigation.


### Announcement
- Deprecated the `--AutoStartDashboard` flag as it is no longer needed.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-13

**NOTE: This version brings major architectural changes to the project. However they are non breaking changes.**

### Changes
- Replaced various filesystem binded tools with elaborate instructions and changes to the workflow to allow AI agents to create documents and manage the project without the need for filesystem tools.
  **Its worth noting this change should improve the accuracy of AI agents following the workflow. Its important to also note this has only been tested with Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Opus 4.1 and GPT 5**
- I have added the ability to use custom spec / steering document templates which is aimed at allowing users to customize the documents to their own needs. This is aimed at Power Users but everyone is welcome to use it.
- Added dynamic year to the spec-workflow-guide tool to ensure the agent is using the current year for web search for more up to date information.

**There are no plans to revert back to the previous architecture. We have made this decision to improve the accuracy of AI agents following the workflow as well as improve the maintainability of the project. If you wish to use the old architecture, you can still do so by running an older version of the MCP server however please note that in the event of a change to the MCP working directory structure, the dashboard or VSCode extension will not work as expected.**
